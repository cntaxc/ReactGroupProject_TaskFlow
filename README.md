# React Group Project: "TaskFlow"

The goal is to build a simple, responsive **Task Management Application** called **"TaskFlow"**. This project must be built entirely using **React Functional Components**, manage its data using **Hooks** (specifically useState and potentially useEffect), implement **Routing** for distinct application views, and be styled efficiently using **Bootstrap**. The entire development process must utilize **GitHub** for version control and collaborative development.
